<h1>Drum Kit Website</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the Drum Kit Website repository! This is a project I developed to create a virtual drum kit using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a touch of jQuery.</p>

  <h2>About the Project</h2>

  <p>The Drum Kit Website allows users to play virtual drums by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard or clicking on the drum buttons displayed on the webpage. The sounds and animations associated with each drum element provide an interactive and engaging experience.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The website is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, allowing users to play the drums on various devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Key and Click Events:</strong> Users can play the drums by pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard or by clicking on the drum buttons with their mouse.</li>
    <li><strong>Drum Sounds:</strong> Each drum element produces a unique sound when played.</li>
